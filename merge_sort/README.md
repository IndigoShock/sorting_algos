# Merge Sort
Implement a merge sort.

## Challenge
The challenge is to implement a merge sort. The merge sort splits the list down the middle into two halves. And continues to half until only the individual values are left. Once values are broken down, each will be merge but sorted back together in as many steps as it was broken down. Once completed, it will be sorted.
